Loan Prediction Dashboard
This repository features a Power BI dashboard designed to analyze and predict loan approvals based on key financial and demographic factors. The dashboard provides actionable insights into the loan application process, enabling better understanding of approval trends, customer profiles, and potential risk factors.

Project Overview
Objective
The main goal of this dashboard is to provide a comprehensive view of loan applications and their outcomes. It focuses on identifying factors influencing loan approval rates and highlights trends that can assist stakeholders in making data-driven decisions.

Key Features
Loan Approval Analysis: Breakdown of approved and rejected loans by various factors such as income, credit history, loan amount, and more.
Customer Demographics: Insights into customer profiles, including age, gender, marital status, and employment type, and their influence on loan outcomes.
Risk Assessment: Visual representation of high-risk vs. low-risk applications to help in identifying patterns.
Interactive Filters: Dynamic slicers to analyze data by region, time period, and loan types, allowing users to drill down into specific segments.
Key Insights from the Dashboard
Approval Trends: Visualizations showing the percentage of approved and rejected loans over time.
Demographic Analysis: Identification of customer groups most likely to have loans approved or rejected.
